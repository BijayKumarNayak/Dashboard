# Task Management Dashboard

A **Task Management Dashboard** developed using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows users to effectively manage their tasks with features such as adding, editing, deleting, toggling completion status, and filtering tasks based on their state.

- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks based on:

  - Completed Tasks
  - Pending Tasks
  - Overdue Tasks (tasks past their due date).
- **Local Storage Integration**: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
